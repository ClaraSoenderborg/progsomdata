# Question 6.1
The third program returns ´Int 7´ which is as expected, as the x variable in line 3 should not have any effect on the result. The function addTwo should set x=2 inside the scope of the add function and save this inside the closure, so it can use it later when called in line 3.
The result of the fourth program is a closure, because the add function is only given one argument, and therefore the y argument is not bound yet.
