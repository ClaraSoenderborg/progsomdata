# Exercise 3.2 
Write a regular expression that recognizes all sequences consisting of a and b where two aâ€™s are always separated by at least one b. For instance, these four strings are legal: b, a, ba, ababbbaba; but these two strings are illegal: aa, babaa.
Construct the corresponding NFA. Try to find a DFA corresponding to the NFA.

    ^(b*|a(b+|$))*$
